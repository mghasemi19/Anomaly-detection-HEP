Anomaly_detection_tutorial

## Overview

This repository contains tutorials and resources for anomaly detection in High Energy Physics (HEP) using deep learning methods. Anomaly detection is crucial for identifying rare events in HEP data, which can be indicative of new physics.

## Anomaly Detection Techniques

- **Supervised Learning**: Techniques where the model is trained on labeled data, learning to distinguish between normal and anomalous events.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Techniques that do not require labeled data. The model learns to identify anomalies based on deviations from normal patterns.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Combines both labeled and unlabeled data to improve anomaly detection performance.

## Explainable AI (XAI)

To enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of deep learning models, this repository also explores Explainable AI (XAI) techniques:

- **Feature Importance**: Methods to identify which features most influence the model's predictions.
- **Visualization**: Tools to visualize the decision-making process of the model, such as saliency maps and attention mechanisms.
- **Model Interpretation**: Techniques to understand the inner workings of the model, including layer-wise relevance propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
